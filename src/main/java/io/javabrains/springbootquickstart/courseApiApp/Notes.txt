What is spring?
An application framework
Has a programming and configuration model
Infrastructure support - support for connecting to databases

Problems with Spring
Huge framework
Multiple setup steps
-MongoDB, RDPMS, JDO, etc.
Multiple configuration steps
Multiple build and deploy steps

Enter Spring Boot
opinionated
convention over configuration
stand alone

Java Dependencies
Jars in Class pot
Maven lets you declare all of the dependencies in a single file

Starting spring boot
Step 1.Tell spring that this is a spring application with an annotation for the main class (@SpringBootApplication)

-Sets up default configuration
-Starts Spring application context
-Perform class path scan
--scans classes for special annotations, treating controller as controllers, services as services, etc.
-Starts Tomcat Server

Let's add a controller
-A Java class
-Marked with annotations
-Has info about:
--What URL access triggers it?
--What method to run when accessed?

Embedded Tomcat Server
-Convenience
-Servlet container config is now application config
-Standalone application
-Useful for microservices architecture

Spring MVC Controller
-Maps a URI and HTTP Method to a Functionality(Java Method)
-Don't worry about converting to JSON, that's done for you

Course API
-Resources
--(Topic, Course, Lesson)
-Topics
--GET  /topics  Gets all topics
--GET  /topics/id  Gets the topic
--POST  /topics  Create new Topic
--PUT  /topics/id  Updates the topic
--DELETE  /topics/is Deletes the topic

-Courses
--GET  /courses  Gets all courses
etc.

-Lessons
--GET  /lessons  Gets all lessons
etc.

In Unit 3
-Starting  Spring Boot App
--Spring Initializr
--Spring Boot CLI
--STS IDE
-Configuration

Customizing Spring Boot
-application.properties


Spring Dats JPA: The Data Tier
-Spring Boot Quick Start

-Spring Data JPA
--Java Persistence API lets you do ORM
--Object-Relational Mapping(SQL)
---Class <-> Table
--SQL is a Relational Database

JPA Repository
-Entity annotation makes Topic into a table with each instance variable as columns in the tables
-ID annotation notates the primary key in the class with the Entity annotation
